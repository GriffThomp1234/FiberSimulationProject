# Fiber Simulation Project

## Overview

The **Fiber Simulation Project** is a collaborative effort to model, simulate, and analyze the physical behavior of fibers under various conditions. The project aims to combine **Finite Element Methods (FEM)**, **Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD)**, and **Multiphysics simulations** into a cohesive framework, integrating insights from machine learning to tackle advanced simulation challenges. 

This project is being developed collaboratively by:
- **Griffin Thompson**: Undergraduate Data Science student at Yale University.
- **Davin Hickman-Chow**: Biomedical Engineering undergraduate at Washington University in St. Louis.

We leverage state-of-the-art simulation techniques to understand and predict fiber behavior, with applications ranging from **biomedical devices** to **aerospace engineering**.
